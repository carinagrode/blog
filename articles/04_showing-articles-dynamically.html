    <h2>Showing Articles Dynamically</h2>
    <p>Actually I just wanted to split the CSS file into smaller files today. I once learned that and forgot it. How was the first line? Ah, okay: <code>@import url('');</code>.</p>
    <p>But then I was curious: I can't repeat the whole website structure on each article page. I bet there's a cool dynamic JavaScript solution.</p>
    <p>And there is. I asked ChatGPT. I don't completely understand the solution, but it works.</p>
    <h3>Today I have:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Splitted the CSS file into two smaller ones</li>
        <li>Substituted a lot of divs with the new cool header, nav, main & footer elements</li>
        <li>Created a JavaScript file for dynamically pulling the articles when clicking on the title</li>
        <li>Aligned the CSS with all of that</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn nav into a sidebar at the left</li>
        <li>Fix the footer CSS</li>
        <li>Create the About page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's like really cold and totally autumn outside. So we need a little summer. Here's an ice cream cone I once made with a pixel art app on my iPhone:</p>
