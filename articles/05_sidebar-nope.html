    <h2>Sidebar? Nope.</h2>
    <p>Today I tried a sidebar. And while struggling with this little thing to keep it between header and footer, I decided: A sidebar as a navigation for the articles is not cool.</p>
    <p>I want it different. Maybe just a main page with the dates and the headings and then you can choose.</p>
    <h3>The other day I have:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Merged my feature branch named dynamic-articles into the main branch again</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Today I have:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the nav to a sidebar</li>
        <li>Tried to adapt the CSS</li>
        <li>Failed</li>
        <li>Changed it back</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cool new main page without sidebar</li>
        <li>Find out why the footer is double the size it's supposed to be</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Today I have a more abstract picture. While doing the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a> one task was to create an Etch-a-Sketch.</p>
    <p>I liked the pattern with the grids very much. It reminded me of the tiles in the metro stations in Berlin.</p>
    <p>So I created my own game <a href="https://carinagrode.github.io/color-combo/">Color Combo</a>: Each time you fill out all the squares with your mouse, you get surprised by a new random color combination.</p>
    <p>And now always when I get a cool combo, I would a screenshot.</p>
