    <h2>Hello Blog!</h2>
    <p>Yes, this is no Hello World. I've already studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript for months now. A little bit every day. And I understand more and more.</p>
    <p>But I want to practice my skills on real projects. And I like writing. So a blog it is.</p>
    <p>I'm just starting and I'm already overwhelmed: Which design? An imprint? Is the headline of an article an h1 oder h2?</p>
    <p>Step by step. I'll find out.</p>
    <h3>Today I have:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Started this blog project</li>
        <li>Created the GitHub repo</li>
        <li>Created the index.html</li>
        <li>Created the first blog post</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create stylesheet</li>
        <li>Generate legal stuff for imprint</li>
        <li>Find out how to structure a blog post with HTML</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also I tested <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/">Stable Diffusion</a> for the first time today and got this cool train between pink clouds:</p>
